PakPlanner â€” Electron-ready package
----------------------------------

This folder contains a Vite + React client and Electron wrapper to run the planner as a desktop app.

Structure:
- electron-main.js  -> Electron main process file (loads ./dist/index.html)
- preload.js        -> Electron preload (empty placeholder)
- package.json      -> (client package.json used for installing client deps)
- dist/             -> (production build output - generated by `npm run build`)
- node_modules/     -> (installed by npm)

HOW TO RUN LOCALLY (simple, no packaging):
1. Install Node.js (if not already) from https://nodejs.org (LTS recommended).
2. Open a terminal and cd into this folder:
   cd pakplanner-electron
3. Install dependencies and build client:
   npm install
   npm run build
   (The Vite build will create ./dist)
4. Install Electron (dev dep) if not installed:
   npm install --save-dev electron
5. Start the Electron app:
   npx electron .

HOW TO PACKAGE (create installer / exe):
- You can use electron-builder. The root build script runs electron-builder after building the client:
  npm install --save-dev electron-builder
  npm run build

- NOTE: Packaging requires additional platform-specific tools for code signing on macOS/Windows if desired.

If you'd like, I can:
- Produce a ready-to-run ZIP with installed node_modules for Windows (very large),
- Or create a scripted GitHub Actions workflow to build installers automatically (recommended),
- Or guide you step-by-step to create the packaged .exe on your machine.
